# Dawgs and Kittehs

You've just been hired by Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. to fix up their website. They have a database of pets and want to be able to:

- Paginate the list of pets
- Filter by pet type
- Sort by pet name and breed

Feel free to use any additional libraries to get this done. We're looking for ability to organize coherent frontend code that is user-friendly. While absolutely not required, if you want to show off ux/design/other chops, have fun with it.

No need to host this anywhere, we just need the code.
