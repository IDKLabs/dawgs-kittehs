# Dawgs and Kittehs

### Before you begin
First of all, thank you for spending the time to work on this project. We know your time is valuable â€” which is why we're using a service called [Takehome.io](http://takehome.io). You should have received an email from Takehome after you cloned this repo that informs you how everything works, but just in case you missed it:
 - You have 2 hours from the time you cloned the repo to make your last `git push`
 - You may commit as many times as you like until the time limit
 - After the time limit, you'll be unable to `git push` as the repo will be closed 

*Why use this method?* We know candidates often feel the need to spend more than the suggested time on take-home projects. This system prevents that from happening, so please just do what you can in the alotted time - we'll assess whatever work gets submitted.

### What we're looking for
This project assesses some of the practical skills we are looking for in a [Fullstack Engineer at Resource](https://angel.co/resource-io/jobs/190489-senior-fullstack-engineer). 

 - React component design, lifecycle and state management
 - Basic UX and layout code
 - Basic API design
 - Ability to balance output with quality

Bonus if you have time
 - Unit tests (run `yarn test` to run your tests, which use `jest`)
 
**Please do not install any additional packages.** The [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) package can be used to make network requests, and anything else you need will be included.

### Your Assignment

You've been hired by Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. to improve their web application. They currently have a database of pets with `name`, `breed`, and `petType`, and a simple site that prints the list. They've provided you with the frontend (a React app) and an API simulated with some javascript and sample data. Use your imagination and assume the methods in `api/index.js` will fetch from an actual database eventually.

Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. have requested you add the following new features. They don't expect you to complete them all, so feel free to pick whichever in order to show off your chops. Have fun with it!

 - <strong>*required*</strong> Pagination (any style - eg. Previous/Next/Page # or Inifite scroll/Load More)
 - <strong>*required*</strong> Handle errors from the API gracefully (see commented code in `src/api/index.js` to simulate errors)
 - Sort by `name` or `breed`
 - Filter by `petType`
 - Click on any pet breed to display information about the breed
   - You'll have a list of pets but no breed information, so you'll need to use an api to fetch information about a specific breed. Start by signing up for an api key [here](https://thedogapi.com/). View documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4016432/the-dog-api/RW81vZ4Z).


### Instructions
1. Please install `yarn`
1. From the project directory, run `yarn install` then `yarn start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
1. Complete what you can within 2 hours, making commits as you make progress on chunks of work
1. `git push` to the repository remote - we'll be notified when it's done!
