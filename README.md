# Dawgs and Kittehs

Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this project. We don't expect you to complete both tasks.

We're primarly looking for ability to organize coherent, logical code. Feel free to use any additional libraries to get this done. While not required, if you want to show off ux/design/other chops, have fun with it!

You've been hired by Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. to fix up their website. They currently have a database of pets with `name`, `breed`, and `petType`, and a simple site that prints the list. 

Task 1: 
Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. would like you to implement pagination. They'd also appreciate the ability to sort by name and breed, and to filter by pet type.

Task 2:
Dawgs and Kittehs Inc. would like to click on any dog to view a modal with information about their breed. You'll have a list of pets but no breed information, so you'll need to use an api. Start by signing up for an api key [here](https://thedogapi.com/). View documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4016432/the-dog-api/RW81vZ4Z).
